Download the source code for this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boundedinfinity/eiab.git
```

This will create the following directory structure:

```
eiab
├── ansible/
├── mkdocs/
├── packer/
├── Brewfile
├── readme.md
├── Makefile 
└── Vagrantfile
```

For the rest of the guide the **eiab** directory will be denoted as something like `$EIAB_DIR` for
the purposes of scripts and examples.
